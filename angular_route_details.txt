				Routes
			   -------

We use one of two methods to declare all application routes in AngularJS: 
the when method and the otherwise method.

angular.module('myApp', []).
config(['$routeProvider', function($routeProvider) {
}]);

1. The first parameter is the route path, which is matched against the
   $location.path, the path of the current URL

2. The second parameter is the configuration object, which determines exactly
   what to do if the route in the first parameter is matched.
   
Configuration object properties:
	1. controller,
	2. template, 
	3. templateURL, 
	4. resolve, 
	5. redirectTo and 
	6.reloadOnSearch
